# Event Management System

The Event Management System is a mobile application built using Expo and React Native. It provides a platform for users to create events, invite team members, assign tasks, and create notes. The system enables efficient event organization and collaboration among team members.

## Features

- **Event Creation**: Users can create events by providing details such as event name, date, time, and location.
- **Member Invitation**: Event creators can invite team members by providing their email addresses. Invitations are sent to the team members to join the event.
- **Task Assignment**: Admin users have the privilege to assign tasks to team members. They can specify the task description, deadline, and additional instructions.
- **Note Creation**: Users can create notes related to the event, such as meeting minutes, important reminders, or discussions. Notes are visible to team members only.
- **Admin Privileges**: Admin users have exclusive access to add tasks and create notes. They have additional control and authority over the event management process.
- **Task Completion**: Team members can mark tasks as completed once they finish their assigned tasks. This provides visibility into task progress and completion.
- **Collaboration**: The system fosters collaboration among team members, allowing them to communicate, share updates, and work together effectively.
